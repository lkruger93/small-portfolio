# small-portfolio
A small portfolio made up of a couple assignments done at SAIT as well as a little of my own personal challenges!  I would love to build this over time as I work more on design and my skills improve!

## 5 page static website
For a CSS assignment in class, I decided to do a website for a horse barn as that is something I am passionate about!  Website link: https://lkruger93.github.io/cpnt260-final/index.html

## Card
Did an assignment for a team card where I chose to do something unique and make a sports profile card for quidditch.  It was a unique and fun challenge which I definitely enjoyed both for the design and its uniqueness.  Pages link: https://lkruger93.github.io/cpnt260-a2/

## Dribbble
Have a Dribbble portfolio/profile which unfortunately is not very long as of yet, it mostly features works from before I began at SAIT so there was a definite learning curve involved in it!  Link: https://dribbble.com/lkruger
